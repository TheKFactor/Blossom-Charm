# 🌸 Blossom Charm – Online Flower Boutique

**Blossom Charm** is a delicately crafted frontend website for a boutique flower shop. Designed with an old-money and soft feminine aesthetic, this project brings to life a graceful online shopping experience where elegance meets nature.

The site simulates a real-world e-commerce flower store, complete with a curated bouquet gallery, a brand story, and a responsive layout. It’s a perfect blend of beauty, functionality, and storytelling — built to showcase frontend design sensibility and creativity.
